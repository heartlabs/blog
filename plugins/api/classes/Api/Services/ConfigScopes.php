 * Decides which config scopes the generic /config and /blueprints/config

 *
 * Core scopes (system, site, media, security, scheduler, backups) are handled
 * by explicit arms in ConfigController / BlueprintController. Beyond those,
 * site authors can drop a top-level config in via the cookbook "add a custom
 * yaml file" recipe — a `user/blueprints/config/<scope>.yaml` paired with a
 * `user/config/<scope>.yaml`. Admin-classic showed those as config tabs
 * automatically; admin2's API used to reject them because every downstream
 * handler hardcoded the 6-scope whitelist.
 *
 * {@see isCustom()} is the single gate those handlers now share. It deliberately
 * keys off a *user/environment-authored* blueprint, NOT the merged
 * `blueprints://config` stream: core ships system blueprints there too (e.g.
 * `streams.yaml`), and those must never become writable through the generic
 * config permission. Requiring the blueprint to live under user:// or
 * environment:// limits custom scopes to ones the site itself defined.
